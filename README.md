# Cements-strenghts-predictor

- This model is predicting compresive strenght and splitting tensile strenght of the cements base on the following 12 inputs.

## Inputs:
          1.       'Compressive strength of cement fce(MPa)'
          2.       'Tensile strength of cement fct(MPa)'
          3.       'Curing age(day)'
          4.       'Dmax of Crushed stone(mm)' 
          5.       'Stone powder content in Sand (%)'
          6.       'Fineness modulus of sand'
          7.       'W/B'
          8.       'Water to cement ratio mw/mc'
          9.       'Water(kg/m3)'
          10.      'cements kgs', 
          11.      'Sand ratio (%)'
          12.      'Slump (mm)'


- Lot of diffrent models are tried on the data, in which the one with higher accuracy is selected for final usage.
- And at the end a GUI with tkinter is created for easy use, you will just enter 12 inputs and will get the 2 desired output.

- Below are two attach images of GUI before entering the inputs and after entering the inputs and get the outputs.

## And this is after geting the outputs, just enter the inputs in each cell and then click the "predict" button and you will get the desire output.
